My current research centers on building agents that are **modular** and **composable**. I believe that modularity can enable `decentralized, continual, and collaborative` model development. One successful instantiation of this is [model MoErging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07057), where different (independently trained) expert models are combined into an MoE-style architecture. To this end, I have done work both on the [**learning** better experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11157) and [**routing** among available experts](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qcQhBli5Ho).

Prior to that, I completed in November my Ph.D. at McGill and the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (Mila), where I was advised by [Joelle Pineau](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/joelle-pineau). My [PhD thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/3bb70bc8503f09bd3c396c56149ce8ab/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) focused on enabling efficient and robust Continual Learning in neural networks.
