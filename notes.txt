### installing jekyll : 
It was a real pain because of ruby install. There was a bug related to M2 macs or something. 
This command ended up solving it
`rvm install ruby-3.2.2 --with-openssl-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1`

### updating much later
because the Docker Image fetch is always the latest, I had to update from the al-folio master branch
